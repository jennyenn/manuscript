        <p>Welcome to Noticed, The Goods' design trend column. </p>
        <p>You know that thing you've been seeing all over the place?</p>
        <p>Allow us to explain it.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong><em>What it is:</em></strong> A digital or print effect where one color fades into another. Typically rendered in soft or pastel tones.</p>    
        <p><strong><em>Where it is:</em></strong> Gradients are seemingly everywhere in media and marketing. They are part of a suite of Facebook status.</p>
        <br> 
        <p>backdrops introduced in 2017 and the branding for the New York Times' popular podcast The Daily, which displays a yellow to blue gradient.</p>

        <p>Gradients have taken over Coachella's app and website (if you watch carefully, the colors shift). Ally's billboard in A Star Is Born is a full-on gradient, and so was the branding for the Oscars ceremony that recognized Lady Gaga. On Instagram, they provide a product backdrop for popular Korean beauty brand Glow, and have been embraced by indie magazines Gossamer and Anxy â€” both designed by Berkeley studio Anagraph. On the luxury front, Brooklyn wallpaper company Calico has released an entire collection of gradient wallpapers called Aurora. Meanwhile, Spanish fashion house Loewe has introduced a version of their trendy Elephant bag in a spectrum of pink to yellow. Are gradients drinkable? Heck yes, they are. Seltzer startup Recess has gone all-in on gradients in their branding.</p>
