<strong>Project 1: Manuscript </strong><br><br>
<p>Hello! This is my first project in the <em> Typography & Interaction</em> course.</p>
<p>The project is about redesigning the typography of an article we chose, using only text. I experimented with different fonts, sizes, and styles to create a text hierarchy, and also tried coding them.</p>
<p>This is my first time learning HTML and CSS. Although it was challenging at first, I find myself really enjoying it! <br>😆 ❤️‍🔥</p>
